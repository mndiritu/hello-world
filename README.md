# hello-world
Introductory learning repository
I am a clinical epidemiologist
I love to imagine and create technological solutions to frontline clinical practice and research
I delved into learning coding in 2006, after struggling to teach myself python for a number of days
since 2005, though I never quite gave it some good effort until 2006.
